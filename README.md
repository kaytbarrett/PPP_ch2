Programming Principles and Practice using C++ (3rd Edition) by Bjarne Stroustrup

Chapter 2: Objects, Types, and Values

This chapter introduces the basics of storing and using data in a program. To do so, we first concentrate on reading in data from the keyboard.
After establishing the fundamental notions of objects, types, values, and variables, we introduce several operators and give many examples of
use of variables of types char, int, double, and string.
